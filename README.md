# File-Retrieval-and-Attribute-Identification-in-a-Client-Server-Architecture-using-C
This client-server model in C enables remote file retrieval and analysis. The client sends a filename, and the server verifies its existence. If found, it transfers the file and identifies if itâ€™s an executable, directory, or read-only file. Using socket programming and system calls, it aids in networking, file handling, and remote file management.
